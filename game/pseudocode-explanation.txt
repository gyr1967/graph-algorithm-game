One way we can express what an algorithm does is through 'pseudocode': a set of instructions designed to be human-readable (think a cake recipe) but
somewhat similar to the code we would write that tells the computer what to do. 
In the pseudocode for BFS and DFS we have some code that is further indented than the rest. This is because they are inside what we call a 
'while loop'. The line that says 'while there is something in the queue' begins this loop, and the pseudocode steps indented inside it
are repeated until the condition is false (the queue is empty)

The second thing to notice is in the Dijkstra pseudocode we have something similar, an 'if condition' that is not repeated, but is executed 
once if the condition is true.
