Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm. This means that it aims to find or 'visit' all the vertices in an unexplored graph.
It does this by making use of a 'queue'. A queue is a data structure that works exactly the same as the queues we humans make when waiting in line;
The first person in is the first person out. 
BFS adds vertices to the queue, then removes the first in the queue, 'visits' it, then adds all of that vertex's unvisited neighbours 
to the queue, until there are no more vertices to visit. 
The queue is represented on the right hand side of the screen, as well as the current vertex.
On the left is the pseudocode, and in the middle is the graph itself, with the controls to choose which vertex
to start on, and step through the algorithm.
The reason it's called Breadth-First is because the algorithm explores wide instead of tunneling deep down one avenue like Depth-First Search does.
