Depth-First Search (DFS) is another graph traversal algorithm. This means that it aims to find or 'visit' all the vertices in an unexplored graph.
It does this by making use of a 'stack'. A stack is a data structure that works exactly the same as a stack of dinner plates; 
The first plate on is the last plate off.
DFS adds vertices to the stack, then removes the first in the stack, 'visits' it, then adds all of that vertex's unvisited neighbours 
to the stack, until there are no more vertices to visit. 
The stack is represented on the right hand side of the screen, as well as the current vertex.
On the left is the pseudocode, and in the middle is the graph itself, with the controls to choose which vertex
to start on, and step through the algorithm.
The reason it's called Depth-First is because the algorithm tunnels deep down one avenue before exploring wider.
You may notice the algorithm is nearly identical to Breadth-First Search, with the only difference being the use of a stack vs a queue, which
affects the order vertices are visited.
