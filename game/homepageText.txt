The purpose of this website is to help build understanding of simple graph algorithms.
Right now the scope covers Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

It is very common to see visualisation of algorithms, whether it's in a youtube video or on a website similar to this one,
however it is not as common to find a way to do the algorithms yourself without using pen and paper which can be hard to keep track
of and is quite a lot of effort.
I find I can learn much better if I go through the motions of whatever I'm learning myself, which is the motivation behind these 
'games' that let you, the player, carry out the steps of some different algorithms.

Hopefully you enjoy!
