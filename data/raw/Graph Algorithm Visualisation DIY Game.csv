The explanations are all very clear and user-friendly and there is just the right amount of text.  I definitely learned how the algorithms work.  Playing the DIY game was more effective than when someone tried to explain it to me. It was good to see 2 similar algorithms side-by-side, and by actually going through the steps in the DIY sections I could see the difference, and I got a real feel for the process. When I went wrong in the DIY sections the hints were really helpful and clear.  By the time I got on to the third graph of each I knew exactly what I was doing and could remember it all.  If I had needed more practice then I could have used different starting vertices, so lots of learning opportunities. I found the Dijkstra's algorithm much harder and the reference to Google Maps confused me a bit.  During the visualisation I was unclear about what Dijkstra's algorithm was actually doing.  A clearer 'shortest paths' box would help me to understand the algorithm better.  The website has left me wanting to learn more. I think an extra section with more info about the application of the algorithms would be a good learning opportunity for me.","There was no distance between A and C on the graph. I had to hit reset when I didn't think I should have to in the depth-first search."

The visualisations help build initial understanding and the DIY section helped me cement it. If there was anything I didn't understand I could practice with the guide still visible and once I felt I was secure I turned it off to test my knowledge.","No technical issues. The only visual improvement I think could be made would be a highlight on each point in the graph when you select it. Currently the only confirmation a selection has been made is the options underneath the graph changing. E.g. When clicking on point B having its border change colour."
