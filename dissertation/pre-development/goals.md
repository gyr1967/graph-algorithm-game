# Goals

##### 1. To develop a web-based graph algorithm game that is fun and engaging for students to play.
* The game should be fun and engaging for students to play.
* The game should be web-based, fast and deployed on a server.
* The game should be easy to use and understand.

##### 2. To develop a game that requires the user to use graph algorithms to complete the game efficiently.
* The game should be able to be completed without using graph algorithms, but it should be much harder to do so.

##### 3. To have a smooth development process, with continuous integration and testing.
* The game should be develped using test-driven development.
* The game should be regularly deployed, ideally using a docker image and a cloud service.
* GitHub actions should be used to run tests on push to develop
* GitHub actions should be used to deploy the game on push to master
