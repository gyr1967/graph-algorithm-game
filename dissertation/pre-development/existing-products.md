### Red Blob Games A* Tutorial
[redblobgames](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
* Explains the concept of a graph with visualisations, making the comparison
between a a top-down view of a room and a graph of the room.

* Lets the user hover over buttons that change the visualisation of the graph

* User can step through stags of the algorithms which are shown on screen

* Builds up the ideas being taught from very basic to more complex. Starts with what a graph is, moves
on to what BFS is, then to Dijkstra's and finally to A*. Very natural and well paced progression.

* Nearly every additional concept is paired with a visualisation of it.

* All done client-side to avoid lag and give smooth animations

* Comment section at bottom of the page where users can ask questions and get answers from the author

###### Graph data structure tutorial

* Must click through a series of dialog boxes that contain
lots of text before getting to the actual visualisation

* User can look at different combinations of weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected graphs 

* User cannot interact with the graph in any way

* The Adjacency list and matrix are shown, as well as the edge list

###### Graph Traversal Tutorial

* Many dialogs to click through

* Steps through the algorithm with the pseudocode step highlighted

* User can choose speed - though slowest speed is still very fast

* Clear visualisation with graphs in the format that is used in lectures in universities which is good for students revision
