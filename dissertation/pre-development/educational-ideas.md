### General
* Theory section w/ brief explanation of algorithm/concept and example(s)
* Practice mode where users can practice on generated graphs
* Stretch goal - timed with leaderboards?

* Graph traversal section
* Path finding section
* Maximum cardinality matching section

* Landing page with explanations about the site and graph theory
* Dashboard for choosing the section (could be the same as the landing page)
* Game Screen which displays the graph, controls (need to decide controls) and instructions/objectives 
* Stretch goal - tutorial section


### Architecture
* Frontend in VueJS due to experience
* Graph visualisation - want it in TS - D3.js or maybe p5.js? 
* Backend - not necessary 
* Algorithms - lightweight enough for frontend - small graphs

### Controls
* Clickable vertices and edges is a bit tricky
* Console at bottom of screen
* Console contains actions based on a currently selected vertex?
* Aiming to step through an algorithm correctly.

### DevOps
* Deploy from the beginning
* GitHub action to push to GCP
* lint-staged for QoL
* TESTS!
* Docker image on GC run?

### Responsiveness
* Desktop only, due to use case from students
