#Pedagogical Principles to Follow

### From 'Busting the Myths of Online Teaching and Learning' - Bill Pelz
These are mostly focussed on teacher-student learning, however I believe the principles will transition over to a teacherless online tool such as this one.

* Let the students do (most of) the work

* Interactivity is the heart and soul of effective asynchronous learning.

* Constructivist model over the objectivist model 
    * "The constructivist model of learning opposes the objectivist idea that the best way to transmit knowledge is dissemination from expert to learner. Instead, proponents of the constructivist model of learning argue that the learner should have more control over the learning process and that indiciduals learn better when they discover things on their own"
* I believe this follows naturally as a criticism of the large amount of text that needs to be read on alternative websites that teach graph algorithms.
