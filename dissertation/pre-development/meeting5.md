* Paper is OK, students have put handdrawn wireframes into their disserations - the intention is to show the work done - as long as it's all labelled, legible and clear it's ok. Doesn't need to be professionally designed it just needs to be clear
* Objective is to develop the app such that the user can learn the concept/thing through using the app - whatever approach is needed that works then that is it.

* In the eval stage, will my app help them learn the thing? See google form from liam for potential questions
* eval needs to make sure that the requirements have been met.
* it's OK to ask the moscow requirements outright
* tick the boxes of the requirements 
* it's called user study for a reason

* cannot design a web app without requirements
* must picture waht it looks like before it is being coded 
* what are the things that are compulsory for this webapp to function the way i want it to function
* requirements may be broad to capture all algs - dont need to talk about every single one - DRY -
* user should be able to follow the instructions
* evaluation is checking if the requirements have been met
* general questions + check the functional requirements in the eval
* has the requirements been met based on what the user thinks 
* unti l ihave a cohesive idea - the requirements will be floating around
* need to know what i want to do before i can synthesise requirements
* picture before requirements
* objectives will come at the end - body of the diss is what comes first and will make way for the introduction
* someone who doesnt know anything about (insert alg here) should be able to come along and follow the set of instructions and be wiser as a result
* output shoudl be a better understanding of graph algorithms

* for implementation - think of simplest and most intuitive
* when i say 'visit' what is the natural move to do?
* get implementing - need to see it in action
* should spend the rest of my time implemeneting
* only when bored/stuck i hsould be looking at diss.
